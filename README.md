# Billboard Chart Visualizations for Exploration

This visualization dashboard was created to explore the trends (or lack thereof) of Billboard Hot 100 
hit songs by joining it with Echo Nest data from the Million Song Dataset. The project can be viewed
at: https://domcarnevale.github.io/billboard_chart_visualizations/.

## Interactions

Feel free to interact with the data! Here's what you can do:
* Filter the data geogrpahically by selecting states on the map
* Filter the data by entry month, key, or mode by selecting pieces of the pie chart with the 
desired field selected in the dropdown
* Filter the data by year range by clicking and dragging across a section of the line graph
* Any combination of the above
